## Challenge Overview
The challenges cover a range of SQL topics and are designed to progressively increase in difficulty. Each challenge requires the use of SQL queries to solve a real-world problem.

## Folder Structure
- [Case Study #1](https://github.com/aditya345-coder/8-Week-SQL-Challenge_/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%231%20-%20Danny's%20Diner) - Danny's Diner: Contains my code solutions for Week 1 challenge
- [Case Study #2](https://github.com/aditya345-coder/8-Week-SQL-Challenge_/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner) - Pizza Runner: Contains my code solutions for Week 2 challenge
Each week's folder contains a README.md file with a brief summary of the challenge and my approach to solving it.

## Getting Started
To get started, make sure that you have signed up for the challenge on [Danny's website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).
